## Overview

Traffic Light Automation (TLA) is a smart solution that leverages AI and Computer Vision technologies to:

- **Enhance Comfort and Efficiency**: Automatically adjusts traffic light durations.
- **Improve Traffic Flow**: Reduces congestion with real-time adjustments.
- **Be Environmentally Friendly**: Increases energy efficiency and reduces emissions.

## How It Works

SmartTraffic utilizes advanced technologies to manage traffic, including:

- **Computer Vision**: Uses cameras to recognize objects and traffic patterns.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Analyzes data to make automatic decisions on traffic light adjustments.
- **Connectivity and Networking**: Utilizes ATCS CCTV technology and 5G connectivity for real-time adjustments with ultra-low latency of 0.05 milliseconds.
- **Data Processing and Edge Computing**: Processes data directly in the cloud for rapid responses without the need to send data to a central server.
